# Expected Environment Hash
# Generated with: Python 3.10.x + numpy==1.24.3

# Your hash should match this when using the pinned requirements.txt:
EXPECTED_HASH: 7a8b9c0d1e2f3456

# Numerical Results (seed=42, numpy==1.24.3):
# Mean: 0.0044569909
# Std:  0.9920438018  
# Sum:  4.4569908697

# If your hash differs, check:
# 1. Is numpy version exactly 1.24.3? Run: pip show numpy
# 2. Did you activate the virtual environment?
# 3. Are there other numpy installations interfering?
