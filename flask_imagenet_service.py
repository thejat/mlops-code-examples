# PyTorch Flask API

This repo contains a sample code to show how to create a Flask API server by deploying our PyTorch model. This is a sample code which goes with [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/flask_rest_api_tutorial.html).

If you'd like to learn how to deploy to Heroku, then check [this repo](https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api-heroku).


## How to 

Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt should have:
    Flask==1.0.3
    torchvision==0.3.0

Run the Flask server:

    FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=[YOUR-FILE-NAME].py flask run


From another tab, send the image file in a request:

    curl -X POST -F file=@cat_pic.jpeg http://localhost:5000/predict
